          <h4>Why Galvanize</h4>
          <p>I finally decided to go to Galvanize because after trying to self teach for years there were still a LOT of things I didn't understand.<br>
            I am really excited to start this path that I have moved on and off of for so long. The thing that drove me to this line of work is my<br>
            passion for puzzles. Coding is like having a big puzzle that has differnt pieces that all fit in the same space and figuring out which<br>
            pieces work best for each new situation is so much fun, even if there is a lot of banging your head off a keyboard involved.</p>
          <h4>After Galvanize?</h4>
          <p>I haven't really given much thought to where I want to go after the program is finished. There are some social media outlets that might<br>
            be fun like Twitter or Pinterest. I was also looking at ways I might give back to the medical community that I was a part of for much of<br>
            my young adult life. I think before I really decide I would like to flex my coding muscles and see what I enjoy most, I guess we will see.</p>
